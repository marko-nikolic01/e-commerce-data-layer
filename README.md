# E-Commerce Data Layer - Big Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing large datasets related to e-commerce products and sales logs. Leveraging Big Data technologies and a structured data pipeline based on the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers), the project ingests raw data, enhances its quality through cleaning and enrichment processes, and transforms it into a refined format ready for advanced analysis and business intelligence.

## Architecture
### Overview

The system processes batch data. E-commerce product and sales data is periodically extracted and placed into the Raw Data Zone. It is then batch processed through the Transformation Zone, where data cleansing, normalization, and enrichment occur. Finally, the refined data is stored in the Curated Zone, making it ready for advanced analytics and data-driven decision-making.

From the Curated Zone, the cleaned and structured data is used to build analysis dashboards.

The entire system is containerized and managed by an orchestration tool.

</p>

### Extraction
Apache NiFi was used for the extraction process, which consists of the following phases:
1. Load batch data from a folder where new files arrive.
2.  For both product and log data, the destination path is set based on the timestamp, ensuring organized storage.
4. Place the files into the **Raw Data Zone** in HDFS.

</p>


### Data Zones

The data pipeline follows the **Medallion Architecture**, which organizes the data into three distinct zones:
1. **Raw Data Zone (Bronze)**
2. **Transformation Zone (Silver)**
3. **Curated Zone (Gold)**

<p align="center">
  <img width="410" alt="Screenshot-2024-06-30-at-18 57 11" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3a0c95f-4051-4d7d-b8d2-fda5294c9387" />
</p>

#### Raw Zone (Bronze)
The **Raw Zone** is located in HDFS and stores the raw data without any transformations. It serves as the initial repository for all incoming batch data, preserving it in its original format for future processing.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2652d4ff-2c10-465d-b1a6-ebd06782e841" alt="Hadoop_logo_new" />
</p>

#### Transformation Zone (Silver)
The **Transformation Zone** is located in HDFS and Apache Hive and contains data that has been cleaned and transformed into a format suitable for further processing and analysis. This zone ensures that the data is structured and ready for more advanced operations.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2652d4ff-2c10-465d-b1a6-ebd06782e841" alt="Hadoop_logo_new" />

</p>

#### Curated Zone (Gold)
The **Curated Zone (Gold)** is located in PostgreSQL and it is where the final, high-quality data is stored. This zone is typically optimized for reporting, dashboarding, and machine learning tasks. The data in the **Curated Zone** is fully cleaned, aggregated, and enriched, ensuring that it's in the most usable form for advanced analysis. This data is ready for decision-making processes, business intelligence tools, and further data science operations.

</p>

### Data Processing
Data is processed using **Apache Spark** and **Python (PySpark)** in 5 main phases for batch processing:
- **Red Phase**: Clean the data from the **Raw Zone (Bronze)** and move it into the **Transformation Zone (Silver)** by designing initial batch processing jobs.
- **Green Phase**: Create a Spark job to combine all cleaned and structured data, and move it into the **Curated Zone (Gold)**.
- **Yellow Phase**: Build the Data Warehouse to store the data for analysis and reporting.
- **Purple Phase**: Implement an alarming system to detect unusually large or irregular orders, and build dashboards for data analytics using.
- **Blue Section**: Represents the user-facing application layer. While not part of the development responsibilities, this application will consume and utilize the processed data delivered by the pipeline.


> **Note**: Metabase was used to build dashboards instead of Tableau.

</p>

#### Red Phase
This phase moves raw data into a structured and clean format using three Spark jobs:
1. **`loadlogsintohive`**: Cleans and loads transactional log data.
2. **`loadcountriesintohive`**: Processes and loads country and region data.
3. **`loadproductsintohive`**: Prepares and loads product information.


#### Green Phase, Yellow Phase and Purple Phase
After the data is cleaned and structured in the **Transformation Zone (Silver)**, it is further processed and enriched to move to the **Curated Zone (Gold)**. This phase consists of several Spark jobs, each designed to analyze and aggregate different aspects of the used car data. These jobs ensure that the data in the **Curated Zone (Gold)** is ready for advanced analysis and reporting.

The following five Spark jobs are used in this phase:
1. **`analyze_e_commerce_data.py`**: Analyzes and enriches e-commerce transaction data, joins various data sources, detects unusual orders, and sends notifications to administrators via email.
2. **`load_unprocessed_logs_into_hive.py`** â€“ Separates the unprocessed logs that lack the necessary information for processing into a separate table, allowing for future repeated analysis.

These jobs help transform and enrich the data, making it ready for visualization, reporting, and advanced analysis in the **Curated Zone (Gold)**.

### Dashboards

The transformed and enriched data in the **Curated Zone (Gold)** is presented and visualized using **Metabase**, an open-source business intelligence tool. For each of the five Spark jobs, a dedicated dashboard is created to visualize the key insights and metrics derived from the processed data.

<p align="center">
